                    <h2>Web Developer</h2>

                    <p>Hello, I'm Jesse Ryan, a passionate and driven individual on a journey to expand my knowledge in coding. My fascination with technoly, problem-solving, and creativity has led me down the path of becoming a skilled programmer. I enjoy the challenge in building websites, and learning new ways to code!</p>

                    <p>I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.mtsac.edu/" target="_blank">Mt. San Antonio College</a> with asperations in CIS, AWS, and coding. I've always been in awe with how rapid the tech world has progressed, and I'm excited to give my contribution - no matter how small - to that progression.</p>
